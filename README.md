Topic Modeling and Document Clustering on 20 Newsgroups Dataset

Celebal Summer Internship Final Project Report ‚Äì Data Science

Author: Faizan RasoolDuration: Summer 2025Dataset: 20 Newsgroups (20K documents)


üéØ Objective
Extract meaningful latent topics from a large text corpus using unsupervised topic modeling and evaluate their alignment with document clusters, both analytically and visually.


üõ†Ô∏è Methodology Overview

Preprocessing: Lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization
Vectorization: TF-IDF with bigrams (ngram_range=(1,2), max_features=5000)
Modeling Techniques: LDA (default + tuned), NMF (base + refined)
Evaluation Metrics: Adjusted Rand Score (ARS), Topic Distribution, t-SNE
Clustering: KMeans (20 clusters) on PCA-reduced TF-IDF features
Dashboard: Interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploration

üìä Adjusted Rand Score (Cluster-Topic Alignment)



Model Type
Description
ARS Score



LDA (default)
Baseline LDA with unigram TF-IDF
0.0404


LDA (tuned)
Batch LDA + n-gram TF-IDF
0.1231


NMF (base)
NMF + n-gram TF-IDF
0.2875


NMF (refined)
NMF + nndsvda init + mu solver
0.2953 ‚úÖ


Insight: Refined NMF achieved the highest cluster-topic alignment.
üíª üìä Streamlit Dashboard

Live URL: 20 Newsgroups Topic Explorer
Features:
Topic Selector: View top 10 words per topic
Top Documents Viewer: Shows 5 sample documents per topic
t-SNE Visualizer: Visualize topics with optional filtering
Topic Distribution Chart: Bar chart of document counts



üìà Final t-SNE Visualization

Each point represents a document
Colors indicate dominant refined NMF topics
Clear separation validates topic distinctiveness

‚úÖ Key Takeaways

Refined NMF with n-grams provided the best topic coherence and cluster alignment (ARS: 0.2953).
t-SNE plots and cluster overlap confirm high model fidelity.
The Streamlit dashboard enables dynamic exploration.

üöÄ Future Work

Incorporate topic coherence metrics (e.g., UMass, NPMI)
Test advanced models like BERTopic, Top2Vec
Add search functionality and clustering visualization overlays

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/faizan1343/20newsgroup.git
cd 20newsgroup


Install Git LFS (for large files like newgroups_cleaned.pkl):
git lfs install


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Dashboard Locally:
streamlit run faizan_20newsgroup.py

üìù Notes

Large files (e.g., newgroups_cleaned.pkl) are managed with Git LFS.
Ensure all .pkl files are in the newgroups_pickle folder.
